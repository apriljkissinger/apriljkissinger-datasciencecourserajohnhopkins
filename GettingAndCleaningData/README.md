1.	codebook.md- Describes the variables in GnCProject.txt and explains the transformations accomplished by the run_analysis.R script on the original data. 
2.	run_analysis.R â€“ Gets the data and applies a series of transformations show below:
    - Merges the ***training*** and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
3.	GnCProject.txt - A tidy dataset created from the original dataset by performing the transformations in run_analysis.R.
